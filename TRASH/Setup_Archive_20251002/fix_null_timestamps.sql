-- FIX NULL TIMESTAMPS IN CELL_TOWER TABLE
-- ===============================================================================
-- This script fixes the NULL values in TIMESTAMP, WINDOW_START_AT, and WINDOW_END_AT
-- columns by deriving them from EVENT_DTTM
--
-- Pattern observed in existing data:
-- - TIMESTAMP: Top of the hour with .001 milliseconds (e.g., 18:00:00.001)
-- - WINDOW_START_AT: 30 minutes before the hour (e.g., 17:30:00.001)
-- - WINDOW_END_AT: 30 minutes after the hour (e.g., 18:30:00.001)
-- - EVENT_DTTM: Random time within the hour (actual event time)
