# Data Generator - Hourly Update Summary

## Date: October 1, 2025

## Status: **âœ… UPDATED TO HOURLY GENERATION**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed NULL Timestamps in Production Data âœ…

**Problem:** 2,051,779 rows (78% of data) had NULL values in TIMESTAMP, WINDOW_START_AT, and WINDOW_END_AT columns.

**Solution:** Updated all NULL timestamps using the EVENT_DTTM column:
- TIMESTAMP = Top of the hour with .001 milliseconds
- WINDOW_START_AT = 30 minutes before the hour with .001 milliseconds
- WINDOW_END_AT = 30 minutes after the hour with .001 milliseconds

**Result:** All 2,626,336 rows now have complete timestamp data.

### 2. Updated Data Generators from Per-Minute to Hourly âœ…

**Old Pattern:**
- Generated one row per CELL_ID every minute
- Tasks ran every 1 minute
- ~14,000 rows/minute = ~846,000 rows/hour

**New Pattern:**
- Generates one row per CELL_ID every hour
- Tasks run every 60 minutes
- ~14,000 rows/hour (one per CELL_ID)

### 3. Timestamp Pattern (Now Matches Production) âœ…

For a 22:00 timestamp:
```
TIMESTAMP:        2025-10-01 22:00:00.001  (Top of hour + .001ms)
EVENT_DTTM:       2025-10-01 22:XX:XX.000  (Random time within the hour)
WINDOW_START_AT:  2025-10-01 21:30:00.001  (30 min before + .001ms)
WINDOW_END_AT:    2025-10-01 22:30:00.001  (30 min after + .001ms)
```

## What Was Updated

### Scripts Modified

1. **fix_null_timestamps.sql** (NEW)
   - Fixed 2M+ NULL timestamps in production CELL_TOWER table
   - Already executed successfully âœ…

2. **update_generators_to_hourly.sql** (NEW)
   - Updated SP_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA() procedure
   - Updated both tasks to 60 MINUTE schedule
   - Already executed successfully âœ…

3. **fix_cell_tower_procedure.sql** (REPLACED)
   - Old version replaced by update_generators_to_hourly.sql
   - Can be deleted (already superseded)

### Database Objects Updated

âœ… **Stored Procedure: SP_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA()**
- Now generates hourly timestamps
- EVENT_DTTM spread randomly throughout the hour
- WINDOW_START_AT and WINDOW_END_AT properly calculated
- Pattern matches production data exactly

âœ… **Stored Procedure: SP_GENERATE_SUPPORT_TICKET()**
- No changes needed (already appropriate for hourly)

âœ… **Task: TASK_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA**
- Schedule changed from `1 MINUTE` to `60 MINUTE`
- Currently SUSPENDED

âœ… **Task: TASK_GENERATE_SUPPORT_TICKET**
- Schedule changed from `1 MINUTE` to `60 MINUTE`
- Currently SUSPENDED

## Verification Results

### Test Execution
```sql
CALL GENERATE.SP_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA();
```

**Result:**
- Generated: 14,109 records (one per CELL_ID) âœ…
- Timestamp: 2025-10-01 22:00:00.001 (correct pattern) âœ…
- EVENT_DTTM: Spread from 22:00:00 to 22:59:59 (correct) âœ…
- WINDOW_START_AT: 21:30:00.001 (correct) âœ…
- WINDOW_END_AT: 22:30:00.001 (correct) âœ…

### Timestamp Pattern Validation

Comparing test data to production pattern:

| Column | Production Pattern | Test Data | Match |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| TIMESTAMP | HH:00:00.001 | 22:00:00.001 | âœ… |
| EVENT_DTTM | Random within hour | 22:00-22:59 | âœ… |
| WINDOW_START_AT | (HH-00:30).001 | 21:30:00.001 | âœ… |
| WINDOW_END_AT | (HH+00:30).001 | 22:30:00.001 | âœ… |

**Status: PERFECT MATCH** âœ…

## How to Use

### Start Hourly Generation

```sql
USE DATABASE TELCO_NETWORK_OPTIMIZATION_PROD;
USE SCHEMA GENERATE;

-- Start both generators
ALTER TASK TASK_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA RESUME;
ALTER TASK TASK_GENERATE_SUPPORT_TICKET RESUME;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Every hour: ~14,000 new cell tower records (one per CELL_ID)
- Every hour: 1 new support ticket
- Timestamps will be on the hour with .001 milliseconds

### Stop Generation

```sql
ALTER TASK TASK_GENERATE_CELL_TOWER_DATA SUSPEND;
ALTER TASK TASK_GENERATE_SUPPORT_TICKET SUSPEND;
```

### Monitor Progress

```sql
-- Check latest generated data
SELECT 
    TIMESTAMP,
    COUNT(*) AS records,
    MIN(EVENT_DTTM) AS earliest_event,
    MAX(EVENT_DTTM) AS latest_event
FROM GENERATE.CELL_TOWER_TEST
GROUP BY TIMESTAMP
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check for next hour to be generated
SELECT 
    DATEADD(HOUR, 1, MAX(TIMESTAMP)) AS next_timestamp_expected
FROM GENERATE.CELL_TOWER_TEST;
```

## Storage Impact

### Previous (Per-Minute)
- Cell tower: ~846,000 rows/hour
- Support tickets: 60 rows/hour
- Total per day: ~20.3M + 1,440 rows

### Current (Hourly)
- Cell tower: ~14,000 rows/hour
- Support tickets: 1 row/hour
- Total per day: ~336K + 24 rows

**Storage Reduction: ~98.4%** ðŸŽ‰

---

## Compute Impact

### Previous (Per-Minute)
- Task executions: 1,440 per day per task
- Cell tower generation: ~2 seconds/execution
- Total compute: ~48 minutes/day

### Current (Hourly)
- Task executions: 24 per day per task
- Cell tower generation: ~2 seconds/execution
- Total compute: ~48 seconds/day

**Compute Reduction: ~98.3%** ðŸŽ‰

## Migration Notes

### Production Data Fixed
- All NULL timestamps in RAW.CELL_TOWER have been populated
- Pattern matches existing non-NULL data
- No data loss or corruption

### Test Tables
- CELL_TOWER_TEST and SUPPORT_TICKETS_TEST have been truncated
- Ready for fresh hourly generation testing
- Previous per-minute test data has been cleared

### Backward Compatibility
- Old procedures have been replaced (not backwards compatible)
- Tasks have been recreated (not backwards compatible)
- If you need to revert, you'll need to restore from backup

- `fix_null_timestamps.sql` - Fixes production NULL timestamps
- `update_generators_to_hourly.sql` - Updates procedures and tasks
- `HOURLY_GENERATOR_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test with Test Tables (Recommended)

1. Start tasks: `ALTER TASK ... RESUME`
2. Let run for 3-5 hours
3. Verify timestamp patterns match production
4. Stop tasks: `ALTER TASK ... SUSPEND`
5. Review data quality

### Option 2: Promote to Production Tables

Once satisfied:

1. Suspend tasks
2. Modify procedures:
   - Change `GENERATE.CELL_TOWER_TEST` â†’ `RAW.CELL_TOWER`
   - Change `GENERATE.SUPPORT_TICKETS_TEST` â†’ `RAW.SUPPORT_TICKETS`
3. Resume tasks
