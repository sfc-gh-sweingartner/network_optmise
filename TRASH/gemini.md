Okay, I've reviewed the YAML file defining the CELL_TOWER, CUSTOMER_LOYALTY, and SUPPORT_TICKETS tables. This is a fairly detailed data model, particularly the CELL_TOWER table with its specific performance metrics.

Here's an analysis regarding its potential source and how such data can be used:

Is this from a public dataset like Kaggle?

Unlikely to be a standard Kaggle dataset in this exact form: While Kaggle and other public dataset repositories host various telecom datasets (often focused on churn prediction, call detail records (CDRs) for fraud detection, or more generalized customer support tickets), the specific schema you've provided, especially the detailed CELL_TOWER performance metrics (e.g., PM_PDCP_LAT_TIME_UL, PM_RRC_CONN_ESTAB_SUCC, PM_ERAB_REL_ABNORMAL_ENB_ACT) and the INDEX field format (ManagedElement=1,ENodeBFunction=3,EUtranCellFDD=...), suggests a model that is either:

Derived from a specific telecom vendor's equipment/OSS (Operations Support System): The PM_ prefixed columns are typical of Performance Management data extracted from network elements. The structure of the INDEX field is also reminiscent of how network elements are identified in some management systems (e.g., related to Ericsson or similar vendor nomenclatures).

A synthetic dataset created for a specific use case or platform: Companies or individuals sometimes create detailed, realistic-looking synthetic datasets for demonstrations, software testing, or educational purposes. The TELCO_NETWORK_OPTIMIZATION_PROD database name in the YAML might hint at a system designed for this purpose.

An internal data model from a telecom operator or a solutions provider that has been shared or described.

Publicly available components might exist: While the exact combined schema might not be a single downloadable public dataset, individual components or similar types of data can be found:

Cell Tower Locations: Public databases of cell tower locations exist (though often without the detailed performance metrics you have).

Customer Support Ticket Datasets: Generic customer support ticket datasets are available on Kaggle (e.g., "Customer Support Ticket Dataset"), but they wouldn't typically have direct, structured links to specific cell tower performance counters or the CELL_ID as a foreign key in this manner without specific pre-processing.

Telecom Performance Metrics: Standards bodies (like 3GPP) define performance metrics, and telecom vendors provide detailed counter descriptions for their equipment. However, raw datasets of these counters are usually proprietary.

In summary for the source: I cannot definitively point to a single, well-known public dataset that matches this entire YAML specification precisely. It has hallmarks of a more specialized or custom-designed schema, likely inspired by real-world telecom operational data.

How to best use this data for network adjustments and cell tower investments?

This data model is rich for making informed network adjustments and cell tower investment decisions. Here’s how the CELL_TOWER and SUPPORT_TICKETS tables, especially when linked, can be leveraged:

1. Correlating Network Performance with Customer Issues:

Identify Problematic Cell Towers:

High Ticket Volume: Filter SUPPORT_TICKETS for CELL_IDs that have a high volume of tickets.

Negative Sentiment: Analyze SENTIMENT_SCORE in SUPPORT_TICKETS to pinpoint CELL_IDs associated with highly dissatisfied customers.

Specific Complaints: Parse the REQUEST field in SUPPORT_TICKETS (using NLP if necessary) to categorize issues (e.g., dropped calls, slow data, no service) and map them to CELL_IDs.

Link to Performance Metrics: Join SUPPORT_TICKETS with CELL_TOWER on CELL_ID. For the problematic cell towers identified above, examine the performance metrics in the CELL_TOWER table around the EVENT_DTTM of the tickets:

Latency Issues: Check PM_PDCP_LAT_TIME_UL, PM_PDCP_LAT_PKT_TRANS_UL, PM_PDCP_LAT_TIME_DL, PM_PDCP_LAT_PKT_TRANS_DL. High latency reported by customers can be validated with these metrics.

Connection Problems: Look at PM_RRC_CONN_ESTAB_SUCC, PM_RRC_CONN_ESTAB_ATT (Radio Resource Control connection success rates), PM_S1_SIG_CONN_ESTAB_SUCC, PM_S1_SIG_CONN_ESTAB_ATT (S1 signaling connection success rates), and PM_ERAB_ESTAB_SUCC_INIT, PM_ERAB_ESTAB_ATT_INIT (E-RAB setup success rates). Low success rates here directly impact user experience.

Dropped Calls/Sessions: Analyze PM_ERAB_REL_ABNORMAL_ENB_ACT, PM_ERAB_REL_ABNORMAL_ENB (abnormal E-RAB releases). CAUSE_CODE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION and CAUSE_CODE_LONG_DESCRIPTION can provide reasons for call drops or failures originating from the network.

Throughput/Speed Issues: Examine PM_ACTIVE_UE_DL_MAX, PM_ACTIVE_UE_UL_MAX, PM_UE_THP_TIME_DL, PM_PDCP_VOL_DL_DRB. Low throughput values or high utilization (PM_PRB_UTIL_DL, PM_PRB_UTIL_UL) might indicate congestion.

Signal Quality: While direct RSRP/RSRQ values for all UEs aren't in the summary facts (those like PM_UE_MEAS_RSRP_SERV_INTRA_FREQ1 seem to be specific measurements), trends in connection drops or low throughput for a cell might imply underlying signal issues.

2. Proactive Network Adjustments:

Trend Analysis: Monitor the CELL_TOWER performance metrics over time (EVENT_DTTM, TIMESTAMP, WINDOW_START_AT, WINDOW_END_AT). Identify degrading trends (e.g., increasing latency, decreasing success rates, rising utilization) before they lead to a surge in support tickets.

Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection on key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from the CELL_TOWER facts. For example, a sudden spike in PM_ERAB_REL_ABNORMAL_ENB or a drop in PM_RRC_CONN_ESTAB_SUCC could indicate an emerging fault.

Predictive Maintenance: Correlate specific CAUSE_CODE_LONG_DESCRIPTION patterns or performance degradation patterns with potential hardware failures or configuration issues. This can inform a predictive maintenance schedule.

Parameter Optimization: For cells showing suboptimal performance but not outright failure (e.g., borderline latency, slightly low throughput affecting a subset of users), network engineers can use this data to fine-tune cell parameters (e.g., handover parameters, power settings, antenna tilts – though these actions are outside the data itself, the data guides these decisions).

3. Strategic Cell Tower Investments:

Capacity Planning:

High Utilization: CELL_IDs consistently showing high PM_PRB_UTIL_DL or PM_PRB_UTIL_UL (Physical Resource Block utilization) are candidates for capacity upgrades (e.g., adding more carriers, new sectors).

High Active Users: PM_ACTIVE_UE_DL_SUM, PM_ACTIVE_UE_UL_SUM, and PM_RRC_CONN_MAX indicate user load. Consistently high numbers suggest a need for more capacity.

Growth Areas: Analyze trends in these metrics over time along with CELL_LATITUDE and CELL_LONGITUDE to identify geographic areas with growing demand.

Coverage Expansion/Optimization:

Support Tickets from Specific Areas: If SUPPORT_TICKETS can be geo-tagged (even roughly, perhaps by cross-referencing CUSTOMER_NAME with CUSTOMER_LOYALTY.ADDRESS if that table contains location data, though the current schema doesn't explicitly link tickets to customer addresses beyond name/email), this can identify coverage holes or weak spots.

"No User Responding" or QoS Issues: Frequent CAUSE_CODE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION like NO_USER_RESPONDING or QOS_NOT_AVAILABLE in areas with expected coverage might indicate a need for a new tower or optimization of existing ones.

New Technology Deployment (e.g., 5G):

Investment decisions for new technologies can be prioritized in areas with high data demand (PM_PDCP_VOL_DL_DRB), high user density, or areas where existing technology is struggling to meet performance targets.

Benchmarking and Vendor Performance:

If VENDOR_NAME is populated, you can compare the performance and reliability of equipment from different vendors across various cells, which can inform future procurement decisions.

4. Enhancing Customer Experience:

Root Cause Analysis for Complaints: When a customer lodges a complaint via a SUPPORT_TICKETS entry, linking to the CELL_TOWER data for the associated CELL_ID around the time of the incident provides invaluable context for customer service agents and technical teams to understand the potential network contribution to the issue.

Setting Realistic Expectations: If network data indicates a known issue or congestion in an area, support teams can provide more accurate information to customers.

Steps to Implement Analysis:

Data Integration and Quality: Ensure the data in both tables is clean, accurate, and that the CELL_ID linkage is reliable. Timestamps are crucial for correlation.

Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): From the raw metrics, calculate relevant KPIs like Call Drop Rate, RRC Setup Success Rate, E-RAB Setup Success Rate, Average Latency, Cell Availability, etc.

Visualization: Use BI tools or dashboards to visualize KPIs geographically (on a map using CELL_LATITUDE, CELL_LONGITUDE) and over time. Overlay support ticket density or sentiment scores.

Alerting: Set up alerts for KPI breaches or significant negative trends.

Advanced Analytics: Employ statistical analysis, machine learning for predictive modeling (e.g., predict cell failures, predict high ticket volumes based on performance trends), and NLP on ticket descriptions for deeper insights.

By systematically analyzing these interconnected datasets, a telecom operator can move from reactive problem-solving to proactive network management and make data-driven investment decisions to optimize performance and customer satisfaction.
