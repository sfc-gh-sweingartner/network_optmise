## This page hasn't been built yet. The plan is...

This page will identify and diagnose problematic cell towers by analyzing:

- High ticket volume areas to find CELL_IDs with unusually high support ticket counts
- Negative sentiment scores to pinpoint towers associated with dissatisfied customers
- Specific complaint categories by parsing the REQUEST field to identify common issues
- Performance metrics linked to customer complaints by joining SUPPORT_TICKETS with CELL_TOWER data

The analysis will focus on latency issues, connection problems, dropped calls/sessions, throughput/speed problems, and signal quality issues to help technicians quickly identify and address the most problematic cell towers.
